**CONTEXT**
You are an experienced full stack web developer and you have been assigned to develop a world-class, fast, and professional using `HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, AnimateOnScroll, JavaScript, FontAwsome, Google Fonts, Foundation, Pure.css`. You have been given little information about the system. But you have gathered the following details `.github/user_requirements.md` from the end users. Read the attached requirements file with the little information you have gathered so far and understand the problem at hand and how we can develop this world class website. The website must be fast, beautiful, animated, fully functional and will be deployed on cPanel domain environment `www.rushsubaru.com`. On top of that the website must have the following requirements:
- Intuitive User Interface (UI) and Experience (UX) (prioritize clean, minimalist designs and logical navigation)
- Responsive Design and Cross-Platform Compatibility (adapts to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones))
- Performance and Speed (Fast loading times, image optimization, caching mechanisms, and asynchronous loading)
- enhance user experience and usability
- use a vibrant blue colour as the main colour on the logo `.github/assets/rushsubaru_logo.png`. there are also other colors of the same logo in the same folder
- use tabs and headless modals where possible  so that we limit the number of  pages
- localize the website to Zimbabwe, no Multilanguage or multicurrency (use English and USD$)
- WebSockets are Supported on cpanel Hosting
- Include git version control
- all exports must be to pdf files only. the pdf generated from the system must have the same layout (heading[logo, company name], document title, contents, footer [generated by, time/date, confidentiality statement, copyright])
- all whatsapp messages must be send to +263 77 638 1498 with customised messages
- all web contact messages must be send to sales@rushsubaru.com and include honeypot to avoid bots and spam. 

Read and understand the project context, understand the attached ussr requirements file with the gathered information with the skeleton of the proposed system functionalities and requirements. 

TASK: 
Generate a project description file `.github/prompts/project_description.md`  with a proper project description. Try to also include and work on the following:
* clearly define the project objective and goals
* outline a simple and clear system and data workflow
* refine the user roles, we only need granular user levels, use one name of each role
* list the pages for each role

i have made some changes to the project description document, read and understand the changes made. 

**CONTEXT**
Using the above project description and attached project description file. The development process must avoid application production hurdles such as (Manual Deployment Errors, Scalability, Cross-Browser and Device Compatibility, Third-Party Integration Complexities). Implement Secure Coding Practices, Design for Scalability and Modularity, Automate Testing and Deployment, Plan a Rollback Strategy. Design considerations and requirement throughout the system are:
- a vibrant scroll indicator with company colors 
- a scroll to top button on the bottom right side of the screen and a floating whatsapp button on the bottom left side.
- include developer credits on every page (developed with ❤️ by bguvava)
- test each page implementation when done, fixing all issues to reach 100% test pass rate(not 99%) with no regressions
- breakdown to do tasks and make sure each module is developed and completed to 100% completion.
- perform comprehensive and thorough test that achieve 100% (not -98%)
- all documentation must be stored in `/docs/{page_name}/` folder
- all test must be run and stored in `/tests/{page_name}/` folder
- all APIs must use the versioning folder for easier updates in future eg using the `api/{version1}/` folder naming
- follow all  Design Guidelines in project description document

**TASK:**
Generate a comprehensive Product Requirement Document(MVP) and save as prompts/product_mvp.md. It must have the following table headings (| Requirement ID | Module Name | Description | User Story | Expected System Behaviour/Outcome | Role |). This MVP must follow and gradual and incremental stepwise format from setting up the development environment using VS Code to developing and design the application system (module by module and feature by feature) until the whole project is complete and deployed.  
The MVP document must contain the following:
- breakdown of page by page, feature by feature
- a list page objectives and features
- a list of page success criteria
- include all the features, modules, and requirements that are mentioned in the  project description document. 
- the system must have a modern neat, beautiful, animated landing page with a login section as the starting point. 

**Breakdown this task into smaller taska that do not overload/hit the chat length limit and assign subagents**

**TASKS:**
Read the attached files and perform the following tasks:
1. create the ".github/prompts/settings.yml" file to help guide the copilot to maintain the project development context
2. Generate the ".github/prompts/coding_style.json" to guide through the development process and maintain the same coding style.
3. Generate the ".github/prompts/copilot_instructions.md" file that will be used to guide its responses and actions by defining the goal, context, expectations vscode copilot to stay in context of the project and know how to respond to the asked questions.
4. generated a ".github/prompts/skills.md" file that will guide the coding agent's skills, expertise and workflows required to develop this system from start to finish without loosing context or hallucinating along the way. These skills must be: specialized capabilities, domain-specific, expertise and workflows required by the full-stack developer. 
5. generate a master prompt that i can use to develop the project phase by phase from phase 1 up to the last phase. the prompt must have context, instructions, dos and dont's, objectives and success criteria and include all project context files. It must have a section to change the current phase of development. It must include the above context files.
